**Model files for simulating the cofilin signaling pathway underlying hippocampal LTP**
===========

*Signaling pathways include*: 

    1. Calcium influx through the NMDA receptor leading to activation of AC1 and AC8, calcineurin, CaMKII  

    2. Norepinephrine, Beta-androgenic receptor, couple to G protein leading to an increase of cAMP, thus PKA activation  

    3. Cofilin activation via Ca/CaMKII and cAMP/PKA: Rac, PAK, SSH and LIMK

 **Note**: *1 and 2 are (from published model (Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek, J., Luczak, V., Abel, T., Blackwell, K.T., 2017. β-adrenergic signaling broadly contributes to LTP induction. PLOS Computational Biology 13, e1005657.)* 

Model_Cofxxx.xml contains the entire model specification, which combines Reaction file (*Rxn_Cof*.xml*), Morphology file (*Morph*.xml*), initial conditions file (*IC_Cof*.xml*), output file (*Out_Cof*.xml*) and stimulation (*Stim_Cof*.xml*). To run simulations, use NeuroRDv3.3.0: 

 	``java -jar /path/to/neurord-3.2.4-all-deps.jar /path/to/Modelfile.xml``

 All output files were first processed using nrdh5_analv2 in https://github.com/neurord/NeuroRDanal 

**Main folder**: Reaction files, stimulation files and Morphology files and updated IC files used in all simulation.

 **Init:** 

    1. To match the in vitro data on basal concentration, simulate the model for about an hour to obtain steady-state concentrations for all molecules 

    2. To copy basal quantities of molecules, run: ARGS="h5_filename -sstart ssend -IC IC_filename -Rxn Rxn_filename -tot tot_species_filename" (-tot is optional) 

    then exec(open('path/to/file/UpdateIC_basal_spatial.py').read()) 

**Exp_1spine**: Model files for simulation with 2 um long dendrite with 1 spine

**Exp_5um_3spines**: Model files for spatial simulation with 5 um long dendrite with 3 spines 

**Exp_10um_3spines**: Model files for spatial simulation with 10 um long dendrite with 3 spines 

The Model reaction kinetics and molecule quantities are summarized in Cofilin_parameters.xls.
